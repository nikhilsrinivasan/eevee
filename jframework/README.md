# Cut through the CRUD

How would you like to build a web app with no boilerplate code at all?

JFramework gives you these rapid prototyping features:

### 1. Full reactivity everywhere, powered by Meteor's `Tracker`

* `J.List` is a reactive Array
* `J.Dict` is a reactive Object
* `J.Component` wraps a React component to add support for reactive field values, and seamlessly turn your render function into a Meteor-style reactive computation

For example: If your `J.Component` has a state variable called `books`, you'd normally have to update it like this:

    this.setState({books: this.state.books.concat([anotherBook])};

Or like this:

    this.state.books.push(anotherBook);
    this.forceUpdate();

With JFramework, you can just say this:

    this.books().push(anotherBook);

Since `this.books()` is a reactive getter for `this.state.books`, whose type is `J.List`, JFramework tracks all dependencies related to this push operation. Your component will then re-render if and only if it needs to rerender.



### 2. "Synchronous" client-side access to your whole database... seriously!

JFramework lets you write synchronous-style `fetch` statements in your components, like this:

    J.defineComponent 'BooksPage',
        state:
            limit:
                default: 10

        render: ->
            $$ ('ul'),
                {}

                $$.Book.fetch(
                    {}
                    limit: @limit()
                ).map (book) =>
                    author = $$.Author.fetchOne book.authorId()

                    $$ ('li'),
                        {}
                        ("#{book.title()} by #{author.name()}")

JFramework then executes your synchronous-style fetch statements asynchronously. And it even bulks your `fetchOne` queries together into `fetch` queries. Which is sweet!

We used to think it was logically impossible to make a framework do this, given the single-threadedness of client-side JavaScript. But we were wrong.



### 3. Reactive URL paths and query strings

`J.Routable` is a mixin that makes your page URL reactive to the state of your top-level `J.Component`, like this:

    J.defineRouter ->
        $$ (ReactRouter.Route),
            name: 'books'
            handler: J.components.BooksPage

    J.defineComponent 'BooksPage',
        mixins: [J.Routable]

        state:
            limit:
                default: 10
            showAuthor:
                default: false

        reactives:
            route:
                val: ->
                    query:
                        limit: @limit()
                        authors: if @showAuthors() then '1'

Now when you visit `/books`, the URL instantly changes to `/books?limit=10`. Then if at some point you change your component's state by calling `@showAuthors true`, the URL will reactively change to `/books?limit=10&showAuthors=1`.

Normally, it sucks to spend time wrangling with your URLs. But with JFramework, it's actually fun.
